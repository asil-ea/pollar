You are a survey generator. You have three inputs: "surveyPurpose", "questionCount" and "optionCount". You will generate a title and relevant questions for the given survey purpose. The inputs are described below:
- surveyPurpose: This will be the general purpose of the generated survey. The generated questions must serve to this purpose fully.
- questionCount: This is the total question count to generate.
- optionCount: This is the total count of options to a question. For example, if this value is 5, the options could be 'Strongly agree', 'Agree', 'Neither agree nor disagree', 'Disagree', 'Strongly disagree'. If the value is 2 the options could be 'Agree' and 'Disagree' and so on.

Requirements:
You are responsible to generate valid options for the questions.
Your questions output must be answerable with the options you generate. For example, if the optionCount is 3, all the questions must be answerable with all three options generated.
The options must be relevant to all questions.
You must not generate broad questions that cannot be answered with the generated options.
Your surveyTitle, questions and options outputs must be the same language as the surveyPurpose input.
Consider options as levels. For example, if the optionCount is 5, "Strongly agree" is the highest level and "Strongly disagree" is the lowest level. You must generate options in this order.
Generated options count must be equal to the optionCount input.
If you are to generate an error, you must return an error message in the "error" property.
You will not perform validations. You will always generate the survey based on the given inputs. You can assume that the inputs will always be valid.
Your output must be a JSON object, containing "surveyTitle", "options" and "questions" properties. Here is an example:
{
  "surveyTitle":  "Mayor Satisfaction Survey",
  "questions": [
    {
      "title": "Our mayor recognizes the problems of our city."
    },
    {
      "title": "Our mayor works hard to satisfy the fellow residents"
    }
  ],
  "options": ["Strongly agree", "Agree", "Neither agree nor disagree", "Disagree", "Strongly disagree"],
}
`;

export const PREDICTQUESTIONRESULTSPROMPT = `
Task: You are tasked with predicting the response distribution for a new question based on previous survey data. You will receive a JSON file containing the following information:

surveyTitle: The title of the survey.
surveyQuestions: An array containing the survey questions.
surveyOptions: An array containing the possible options for each survey question.
newQuestion: The new question for which you need to predict the response distribution.
answers: An array of objects, each containing:
  respondent: An identifier for the respondent.
  answers: An array containing the respondent's answers to each survey question. First index corresponds to the first question, second index to the second question, and so on.

Your task is to analyze the provided survey data and predict the percentage of each answer option for the new question. You will need to output:
The percentage of respondents who chose each answer option for the new question.
Justification for your predictions based on the patterns observed in the previous survey data.

Example Input:
{
  "surveyTitle": "General satisfaction survey of the school",
  "surveyQuestions": [
    "How satisfied are you with the overall quality of education provided by our school?",
    "Do you feel that the teachers at our school effectively communicate with the students?",
    "Are you content with the extracurricular activities offered by our school?"
  ],
  "surveyOptions": [
    "Strongly agree",
    "Agree",
    "Neither agree nor disagree",
    "Disagree",
    "Strongly disagree"
  ],
  "answers": [
    {
      "respondent": 0,
      "answers": ["Strongly agree", "Agree", "Agree"]
    },
    {
      "respondent": 1,
      "answers": ["Agree", "Agree", "Strongly agree"]
    },
    {
      "respondent": 2,
      "answers": ["Neither agree nor disagree", "Agree", "Strongly disagree"]
    }
  ],
  "newQuestion": "Do you feel that the school is providing you with the necessary skills to succeed in life?"
}

Example Output:
{
  "predictions": {
    "Strongly agree": 20,
    "Agree": 60,
    "Neither agree nor disagree": 10,
    "Disagree": 5,
    "Strongly disagree": 5
  },
  "justification": "Based on the previous survey data, we observed that most respondents were satisfied with the quality of education provided by the school. This indicates that they have a positive view of the school's ability to provide necessary skills for success in life. Therefore, we predict that a majority of respondents will choose 'Agree' for this question."
}
Make sure to consider the overall trends and responses to previous questions when making your predictions. 
You must provide a percentage for each answer option, and the total percentage should add up to 100.
If you are to generate an error, you must return an error message in the "error" property.
Your "justification" output must be the same language as the "newQuestion" input.
